# container_monitor

The Container Monitor cookbook allows you to deploy a monitoring solution on your Ubuntu Server using Chef. 

It installs and configures the following services:

Icinga2
Icingaweb2 Module
Docker
MySQL
Apache

It also configures two docker containers (Apache and MySQL) on the fly so that you can test the system
right away.
